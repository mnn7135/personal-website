# Useful Tips

## Debugging in VSCode

This project offers a debugging configuration for the NextJS application:

1. **Full Stack Debugging**
    - Debugs both client and server code simultaneously
    - Select "Next.js: debug full stack" from the debug dropdown
    - Best when working with data flow between frontend and backend

### How to Debug:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open the Debug sidebar
2. Select your debug configuration from the dropdown
3. Press `F5` or click the green play button to start debugging
4. Set breakpoints by clicking to the left of line numbers
5. Use the debug toolbar to step through code
