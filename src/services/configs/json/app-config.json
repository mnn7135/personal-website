    "SMALL_BLURB_SECTION": "FIRST Robotics",
    "SMALL_BLURB_DESCRIPTION": "In High School, I was a robotics team member for three years. FIRST Robotics is a high school-level competition where teams design a robot each year to compete in an alliance-based game. Robotics is where I started developing my skills in Java, the programming language I have the most experience with. For the software sub-team, we spent most of our time working with the robot (in its earliest iteration when available). In this case, our system was a rough agile system –we used Trello and Slack, and through both iterations of robots and code, a final iteration would emerge. In my senior year, I was the leader of the software sub-team, and I worked on the drive train and controls of the robot. The API libraries provided by FIRST were not suited to the system we were using, so I had to create a different solution. The drive train worked great, and using its base, we developed an autonomous period routine (where no human driver is allowed) that allowed the driver to ignore the sandstorm period and gave full power to the robot to place a hatch on its own. Robotics allowed me to develop my programming abilities with the ability to test code and, in some cases, be able to make changes on the fly.",
